# Find the Nearest Common Ancestor of a given tree
## Goal
To find the nearest common ancestor of two given elements in a n-ary tree. Each element only have a single ancestor,  as well as the tree with only a single root ancestor.
## Input
To validate the program, a series of inputs have been provided, in which element or node of the tree is represented by a character. To be able to use them in the developed program  these characters have been replaced by ordinal numbers.
You can find the input files, as well as the corresponding outputs in the dataset folder.
### Input format
The input files have 2 columns. The left column corresponds to the input provided, and the right column corresponds to the adapted input to run the program. The first line of the right column is the number of elements in the tree (n), the next n-1 lines corresponds to the pairs parent / child, the last columns are the pairs to determine the nearest common ancestor by the program.
To run the program, first it asks you to specify the number of elements in the tree and then enter the pairs of parent with the corresponding child. Once the tree is defined, it will ask which pair of elements/nodes do you want to know the nearest common ancestor. You can only request the nearest common ancestor of one pair each time you run the program.
